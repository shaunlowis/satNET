# satNET
For code development in relation to the satNET model.

# **Overlying Idea**
If you imagine the space around the Earth as a bedsheet, you have satellites rolling across the bedsheet in orbit with earth. 
If you have add more satellites, the orbits of the rest change due to the new curve of the sheet. 
As a result of this change in orbit, you can figure out where the new satellites are and how much they curve the sheet by and therefore their mass. 
If you start with just a few satellites in the model, you can look at their orbits and can tell by their paths what objects must be affecting their orbits and where these objects are.
If we can only do it for a few satellites, it already would show promise, since ESA and NASA both have debris tracking satellites in orbit already that measure these things to a very high degree of accuracy.

Once the basic orbital mechanics are figured out, we should be able to write a self-generating machine learning approach to making a map of near-earth space debris.
This would be done using the above relativistic gravity approach.

For all code development: Use [nbdev](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev) and jupyter notebooks and python files for utility functions.
